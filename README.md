# Getting Started and Instructions:
	This is a simple blog website I created. To start you must have django installed. For the sake of this setup I'm going to assume you are using a mac or ubuntu.

	1) To use django you will need python installed first. You will go to the terminal, and type 'sudo apt install python-pip'
	2) You will also need to install git to clone the project file. Use the command 'sudo apt install git'
	3) Once you install python, use the command 'pip install Django'
	4) Use the command 'git clone https://github.com/Kyotense/Blogsite' to clone the repository with the blog website.
	5) The website has a two dependencies. Use the commands below to install the dependencies:
		a) pip install django-taggit
		b) pip install Pillow
	6) Traverse in the terminal to Blogsite/Django-blog/mysite directory. 
	7) Run the website by using the 'python manage.py runserver'. Afterwards, the website should be running the website. Go to the url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'.
